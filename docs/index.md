react-jsonschema-form
=====================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mozilla-services/react-jsonschema-form.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/mozilla-services/react-jsonschema-form)

A simple [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/) component capable of building HTML forms out of a [JSON schema](http://json-schema.org/) and using [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) semantics by default.

A [live playground](https://mozilla-services.github.io/react-jsonschema-form/) is hosted on gh-pages.

## Philosophy

react-jsonschema-form is meant to automatically generate a React form based on a [JSON Schema](http://json-schema.org/). It is a major component in the [kinto-admin](https://github.com/Kinto/kinto-admin/) project. If you want to generate a form for any data, sight unseen, simply given a JSON schema, react-jsonschema-form may be for you. If you have _a priori_ knowledge of your data and want a toolkit for generating forms for it, you might look elsewhere.

react-jsonschema-form validates that the data conforms to the given schema, but doesn't prevent the user from inputing data that doesn't fit (for example, stripping non-numbers from a number field, or adding values to an array that is already "full").

## Installation

Requires React 15.0.0+.

> Note: The `master` branch of the repository reflects ongoing development. Releases are published as [tags](https://github.com/mozilla-services/react-jsonschema-form/releases). You should never blindly install from `master`, but rather check what the available stable releases are.


### As a npm-based project dependency

```bash
$ npm install react-jsonschema-form --save
```

> Note: While the library renders [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) HTML semantics, you have to build and load the Bootstrap styles on your own.

### As a script served from a CDN

```html
  <script src="https://unpkg.com/react-jsonschema-form/dist/react-jsonschema-form.js"></script>
```

Source maps are available at [this url](https://unpkg.com/react-jsonschema-form/dist/react-jsonschema-form.js.map).

> Note: The CDN version **does not** embed `react` or `react-dom`.

You'll also need to alias the default export property to use the Form component:

```jsx
const Form = JSONSchemaForm.default;
// or
const {default: Form} = JSONSchemaForm;
```

## Usage

```jsx
import React, { Component } from "react";
import { render } from "react-dom";

import Form from "react-jsonschema-form";

const schema = {
  title: "Todo",
  type: "object",
  required: ["title"],
  properties: {
    title: {type: "string", title: "Title", default: "A new task"},
    done: {type: "boolean", title: "Done?", default: false}
  }
};

const log = (type) => console.log.bind(console, type);

render((
  <Form schema={schema}
        onChange={log("changed")}
        onSubmit={log("submitted")}
        onError={log("errors")} />
), document.getElementById("app"));
```

This will generate a form like this (assuming you loaded the standard [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) stylesheet):

### Form initialization

Often you'll want to prefill a form with existing data; this is done by passing a `formData` prop object matching the schema:

```jsx
const formData = {
  title: "First task",
  done: true
};

render((
  <Form schema={schema}
        formData={formData} />
), document.getElementById("app"));
```

> Note: If your form has a single field, pass a single value to `formData`. ex: `formData='Charlie'`

> WARNING: If you have situations where your parent component can re-render, make sure you listen to the `onChange` event and update the data you pass to the `formData` attribute.

### Form event handlers

#### Form submission

You can pass a function as the `onSubmit` prop of your `Form` component to listen to when the form is submitted and its data are valid. It will be passed a result object having a `formData` attribute, which is the valid form data you're usually after. The original event will also be passed as a second parameter:

```js
const onSubmit = ({formData}, e) => console.log("Data submitted: ",  formData);

render((
  <Form schema={schema}
        onSubmit={onSubmit} />
), document.getElementById("app"));
```

#### Form error event handler

To react when submitted form data are invalid, pass an `onError` handler. It will be passed the list of encountered errors:

```js
const onError = (errors) => console.log("I have", errors.length, "errors to fix");

render((
  <Form schema={schema}
        onError={onError} />
), document.getElementById("app"));
```

#### Form data changes

If you plan on being notified every time the form data are updated, you can pass an `onChange` handler, which will receive the same args as `onSubmit` any time a value is updated in the form.

#### Form field blur events

Sometimes you may want to trigger events or modify external state when a field has been touched, so you can pass an `onBlur` handler, which will receive the id of the input that was blurred and the field value.

#### Form field focus events

Sometimes you may want to trigger events or modify external state when a field has been focused, so you can pass an `onFocus` handler, which will receive the id of the input that is focused and the field value.

### Submit form programmatically
You can use the reference to get your `Form` component and call the `submit` method to submit the form programmatically without a submit button.
This method will dispatch the `submit` event of the form, and the function, that is passed to `onSubmit` props, will be called.

```js
const onSubmit = ({formData}) => console.log("Data submitted: ",  formData);
let yourForm;

render((
  <Form schema={schema}
        onSubmit={onSubmit} ref={(form) => {yourForm = form;}}/>
), document.getElementById("app"));

yourForm.submit();
```

## Styling your forms

This library renders form fields and widgets leveraging the [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) semantics. That means your forms will be beautiful by default if you're loading its stylesheet in your page.

You're not necessarily forced to use Bootstrap; while it uses its semantics, it also provides a bunch of other class names so you can bring new styles or override default ones quite easily in your own personalized stylesheet. That's just HTML after allÂ :)

If you're okay with using styles from the Bootstrap ecosystem though, then the good news is that you have access to many themes for it, which are compatible with our generated forms!

Here are some examples from the [playground](http://mozilla-services.github.io/react-jsonschema-form/), using some of the [Bootswatch](http://bootswatch.com/) free themes:

![](https://i.imgur.com/IMFqMwK.png)
![](https://i.imgur.com/HOACwt5.png)

Last, if you really really want to override the semantics generated by the lib, you can always create and use your own custom [widget](advanced-customization.md#custom-widget-components), [field](advanced-customization.md#custom-field-components) and/or [schema field](advanced-customization.md#custom-schemafield) components.


## JSON Schema supporting status

This component follows [JSON Schema](http://json-schema.org/documentation.html) specs. Due to the limitation of form widgets, there are some exceptions as follows:

* `additionalItems` keyword for arrays

    This keyword works when `items` is an array. `additionalItems: true` is not supported because there's no widget to represent an item of any type. In this case it will be treated as no additional items allowed. `additionalItems` being a valid schema is supported.

* `anyOf`, `allOf`, and `oneOf`, or multiple `types` (i.e. `"type": ["string", "array"]`)

    The `anyOf`  and `oneOf` keywords are supported,  however, properties declared inside the `anyOf/oneOf` should not overlap with properties "outside" of the `anyOf/oneOf`.

    You can also use `oneOf` with [schema dependencies](dependencies.md#schema-dependencies) to dynamically add schema properties based on input data.

* `"additionalProperties":false` produces incorrect schemas when used with [schema dependencies](#schema-dependencies). This library does not remove extra properties, which causes validation to fail. It is recommended to avoid setting `"additionalProperties":false` when you use schema dependencies. See [#848](https://github.com/mozilla-services/react-jsonschema-form/issues/848) [#902](https://github.com/mozilla-services/react-jsonschema-form/issues/902) [#992](https://github.com/mozilla-services/react-jsonschema-form/issues/992)

## FAQ

### Q: Does rjsf support `oneOf`, `anyOf`, multiple types in an array, etc.?

A: The `anyOf`  and `oneOf` keywords are supported,  however, properties declared inside the `anyOf/oneOf` should not overlap with properties "outside" of the `anyOf/oneOf`.
There is also special cased where you can use `oneOf` in [schema dependencies](dependencies.md#schema-dependencies), If you'd like to help improve support for these keywords, see the following issues for inspiration [#329](https://github.com/mozilla-services/react-jsonschema-form/pull/329) or [#417](https://github.com/mozilla-services/react-jsonschema-form/pull/417). See also: [#52](https://github.com/mozilla-services/react-jsonschema-form/issues/52), [#151](https://github.com/mozilla-services/react-jsonschema-form/issues/151), [#171](https://github.com/mozilla-services/react-jsonschema-form/issues/171), [#200](https://github.com/mozilla-services/react-jsonschema-form/issues/200), [#282](https://github.com/mozilla-services/react-jsonschema-form/issues/282), [#302](https://github.com/mozilla-services/react-jsonschema-form/pull/302), [#330](https://github.com/mozilla-services/react-jsonschema-form/issues/330), [#430](https://github.com/mozilla-services/react-jsonschema-form/issues/430), [#522](https://github.com/mozilla-services/react-jsonschema-form/issues/522), [#538](https://github.com/mozilla-services/react-jsonschema-form/issues/538), [#551](https://github.com/mozilla-services/react-jsonschema-form/issues/551), [#552](https://github.com/mozilla-services/react-jsonschema-form/issues/552), or [#648](https://github.com/mozilla-services/react-jsonschema-form/issues/648).

In addition, "nullable" types are supported in a narrow sense: If a property declares a type of `["<some-type>", "null"]`, then `"some-type"` will be passed through as the type used to determine which widget to use for rendering the field. However, the actual rendering and handling of the field is unchanged; you are free to handle this using an approach (`'ui:emptyValue': null`, for example) best-suited to your use case.

### Q: Will react-jsonschema-form support Material, Ant-Design, Foundation, or [some other specific widget library or frontend style]?

A: Probably not. We use Bootstrap v3 and it works fine for our needs. We would like for react-jsonschema-form to support other frameworks, we just don't want to support them ourselves. Ideally, these frontend styles could be added to react-jsonschema-form with a third-party library. If there is a technical limitation preventing this, please consider opening a PR. See also: [#91](https://github.com/mozilla-services/react-jsonschema-form/issues/91), [#99](https://github.com/mozilla-services/react-jsonschema-form/issues/99), [#125](https://github.com/mozilla-services/react-jsonschema-form/issues/125), [#237](https://github.com/mozilla-services/react-jsonschema-form/issues/237), [#287](https://github.com/mozilla-services/react-jsonschema-form/issues/287), [#299](https://github.com/mozilla-services/react-jsonschema-form/issues/299), [#440](https://github.com/mozilla-services/react-jsonschema-form/issues/440), [#461](https://github.com/mozilla-services/react-jsonschema-form/issues/461), [#546](https://github.com/mozilla-services/react-jsonschema-form/issues/546), [#555](https://github.com/mozilla-services/react-jsonschema-form/issues/555), [#626](https://github.com/mozilla-services/react-jsonschema-form/issues/626), and [#623](https://github.com/mozilla-services/react-jsonschema-form/pull/623).

### Q: Is there a way to "collapse" fields, for instance to show/hide individual fields?

A: There's no specific built-in way to do this, but you can write your own FieldTemplate that supports hiding/showing fields according to user input. See the "tips and tricks" section above for one example implementation. See also: [#268](https://github.com/mozilla-services/react-jsonschema-form/issues/268), [#304](https://github.com/mozilla-services/react-jsonschema-form/pull/304), [#598](https://github.com/mozilla-services/react-jsonschema-form/issues/598), [#920](https://github.com/mozilla-services/react-jsonschema-form/issues/920).
